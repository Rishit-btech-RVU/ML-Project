# **Food Spoilage Detection System**  
A smart AI-powered system that detects and monitors food spoilage using computer vision and machine learning.  

## **Overview**  
Food waste is a major global issue, and early detection of spoilage can help minimize losses. This project leverages image analysis techniques to identify visual signs of food spoilage across different food categories, providing timely alerts to users.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **Real-time spoilage detection** using AI-powered image analysis  
✅ **Multi-category food support** for various perishable items  
✅ **Visual condition assessment** to track freshness levels  
✅ **Spoilage probability estimation** for predictive insights  
✅ **Early warning notifications** to prevent food wastage  

## **Setup & Installation**  
1. **Clone the repository**  
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables**  
4. **Run the application**  

## **Usage**  
1. Place food items in front of the camera.  
2. Start the detection system:  
   ```bash
   python detect_spoilage.py
   ```  
3. View real-time results and spoilage probability in the output window.
